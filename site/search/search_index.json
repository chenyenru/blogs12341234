Information : The genetic material must contain the information necessary to construct an entire organism. In other words, it must provide the blueprint to determine the inherited traits of an organism. Transmission : During reproduction, the genetic material must be passed from parents to offspring. Replication : Because the genetic material is passed from parents to offspring, and from mother cell to daughter cells during cell division, it must be copied. Variation : Within any species, a significant amount of phenotypic variability occurs. For example, Mendel studied several characteristics in pea plants that varied among different plants. These included height (tall versus dwarf) and seed color (yellow versus green). Therefore, the genetic material must also vary in ways that can account for the known phenotypic differences within each species.","title":"Chapter 9 Note (MOLECULAR STRUCTURE OF DNA AND RNA)"},{"location":"Research%20Project/Genetics%20Textbook/DNA%20Structure%20and%20Sequencing/","text":"","title":"DNA Structure and Sequencing"},{"location":"Research%20Project/Genetics%20Textbook/MIT%20Intro%20To%20Biology/Lecture%201%20Welcome%20Introduction%20and%20Course%20Organization/","text":"Lecture 1: Welcome; Introduction and Course Organization \u00b6 bio #bioinformatics #major #life #fun \u00b6","title":"Lecture 1: Welcome; Introduction and Course Organization"},{"location":"Research%20Project/Genetics%20Textbook/MIT%20Intro%20To%20Biology/Lecture%201%20Welcome%20Introduction%20and%20Course%20Organization/#lecture-1-welcome-introduction-and-course-organization","text":"","title":"Lecture 1: Welcome; Introduction and Course Organization"},{"location":"Research%20Project/Genetics%20Textbook/MIT%20Intro%20To%20Biology/Lecture%201%20Welcome%20Introduction%20and%20Course%20Organization/#bio-bioinformatics-major-life-fun","text":"","title":"bio #bioinformatics #major #life #fun"},{"location":"Research%20Project/Meeting%20Notes/20210928%20Opening/","text":"Below is my current understanding, progress, and questions.

Primarily struggling on finding an interesting thing to frame the topic. notable things: - familiarized myself with those databases. - including Firebrowse, TargetScan, TCGA, RNACards. - Learned how to navigate in those places - identified 2 mirnas that are most conserved in znf646 and znf280c. - However, then found that they are already well-researched. In a nutshell: was struggling with framing a research topic Today, I've consulted someone who had past experience in the field, and he recommended me possibly frame my research topic as finding correlation between a gene or mirna and the development of cancer. Or that I can try to find something interesting from the gene's expression and perhaps investigate into its function. THUS, my plan for next week: Draft a rough topic 1. start learning about genetics, genomics, proteins, mirnas, etc. from online courses 2. find interesting huge gene expression","title":"20211012 Meeting with Michael about further research"},{"location":"Research%20Project/Progress%20Notes/1101_to_1116%20Planning/","text":"bioinformatics #research #project #fun #goal \u00b6 This week: - [x] Find Courses for Biology - [x] Continue Learning Bioinformatics - [x] Find Analysis Tools Useful Quora Post \u00b6 How can I start doing research in bioinformatics or computational biology independently? : - (A) Learn about bioinformatics by reading books and scientific articles (B) Get involved in the online bioinformatics community (C) Read bioinformatics blogs (D) Learn about the key technologies that lead to the boom of bioinformatics (microarrays, high throughput sequencing etc.) (E) Grab some data from public databases and start analyzing!
