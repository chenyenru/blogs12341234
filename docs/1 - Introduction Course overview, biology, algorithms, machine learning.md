**CG** is stronger than **AT** because it has ==3== Hydrogen bonds rather than ==2==
**DNA** has *ANTI-parallel structure*

**Histone** regulates gene expression
**Methyl group** can also tag DNA and *activate* or *repress* genes
**Epigenetic** changes are modifications to DNA that regulate whether genes are turned on or off
