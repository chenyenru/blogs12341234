## Useful Quora Post
[How can I start doing research in bioinformatics or computational biology independently?](https://www.quora.com/How-can-I-start-doing-research-in-bioinformatics-or-computational-biology-independently):
- (A) Learn about bioinformatics by reading books and scientific articles  
(B) Get involved in the online bioinformatics community  
(C) Read bioinformatics blogs  
(D) Learn about the key technologies that lead to the boom of bioinformatics (microarrays, high throughput sequencing etc.)  
(E) Grab some data from public databases and start analyzing!  
(F) Learn about the mathematics and statistics involved (machine learning, hidden markov models etc.)
- brushing up and learning about ==cell biology, genetics, proteomics and sequencing== (as these are some of the biggest bioinformatics fields).
- Bioinformatics blogs/communities  
[Homolog.us - Frontier in Bioinformatics](http://homolog.us/ "homolog.us")  
[https://www.biostars.org/](https://www.biostars.org/ "www.biostars.org")

  
Public databases (some examples)  
[Home - GEO - NCBI](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/ "www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov")

- a public database for microarray and other functional genomics data  
[Ensembl Genome Browser](http://www.ensembl.org/index.html "www.ensembl.org")  
[UniProt](http://www.uniprot.org/ "www.uniprot.org")  
[UCSC Genome Browser Home](http://genome.ucsc.edu/ "genome.ucsc.edu")

Some CS flavoured Bioinformatics projects

[Bioconductor - Home](http://www.bioconductor.org/ "www.bioconductor.org")

(a lot of microarray data is analysed using Bioconductor packages written in R)

[biojava.org](http://biojava.org/wiki/Main_Page "biojava.org")

- using Java to process biological data

[Online bioinformatics analysis for everyone](http://galaxyproject.org/ "galaxyproject.org")

**A potential starter project:  **
Global sequence alignment is an important problem in bioinformatics. Aligning two sequences, whether nucleotide or amino acid, can help to detemine conserved regions of potential functional importance. Research the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm and implement it. Try it on some sequences of your choice.

## Tools
Potential datasets:
> But in terms of getting datasets, there are fortunately a lot of publicly available datasets available. GEO has NGS, microarray, single cell, etc... data from different platforms. TCGA has a huge amount of data on different cancers. Those are the two that I personally work with, so they came to mind. But there are so many others.
### Dataset 
- GEO Dataset
	- [Video Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQ24T9fpXvg)
		- Microarray analysis: find similarity in gene expression
			- Thus, GEO data comes in handy
- [Open Neuro](https://openneuro.org/)

## Analysis
- Bioconductor: analysis and comprehension of high-throughput genomic data
	- Tutorial: [[MGED6I.pdf]]
	- [Video Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzY7bPQOXUs)
	- [Workshop sessions](https://github.com/federicomarini/GeneTonicWorkshop)
- TCGA datasets:

Goal for next two week: [[1117_to_1123 Playimg Around#Todo]]
- [ ] look through other's github analysis for gene
- [ ] have a draft of topic
- [ ] take at least 2 lectures of each course
- [ ] at least complete GEO analysis to get an idea of these analysis
	- [ ]  play with TCGA
	- [ ]  play with GEO
	- [ ]  try the analysis tools listed in the research paper
