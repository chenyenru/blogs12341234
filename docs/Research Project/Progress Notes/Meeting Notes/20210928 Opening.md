Below is my current understanding, progress, and questions.

1. Bioinformatics
	1. Inclined Topic: Cancer Genomics
	2. Currently doing research in a group called Teens for Cancer Patients
		1. We're planning to look into promising genes that would possibly be helpful for cancer
	3. I hope to do a parallel project on different genes that focus on investigating another gene that is still not well-researched while also hoping to gain more computation biology skills throughout the process
	4.  taking a [coursera course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-genomics/home/welcome)
		--> trying to get more knowledge on genomics and bioinformatics

## helps
- Perhaps mentorship and your views when determining a research topic and planning
	- basically having your views on these would be great
	- also so that I can keep my accountability 

## majors questions
- from what I know, people usually enter computational biology or bioinformatics in their master. Thus, I'm curious if you have any recommendations on the majors to choose in bachelor?
	- I'm current thinking:
		1. Computational biology
		2. biology
		3. molecular and cellular biology
		4. statistics with potential concentration on biostatistics
		5. biomedical computation
