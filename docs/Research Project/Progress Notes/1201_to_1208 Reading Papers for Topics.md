## Topics
### 1st paper on identifying potential crucial genes
[Identification of Potential Crucial Genes and Key Pathways in Breast Cancer Using Bioinformatic Analysis](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fgene.2019.00695/full)
#### Analysis Methods:
- Four datasets (GSE21422, GSE29431, GSE42568, and GSE61304) from Gene Expression Omnibus (**GEO**)
-  Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset were used for the bioinformatic analysis
--> Thus, I think a potential topic for this can be:
- *Identification of Potential Crucial Genes and Key Pathways in Astrocytomas Using Bioinformatic Analysis* (Astrocytomas/Giloma is a type of brain cancer)
	- Datasets
		- [TCGA-GLM](https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/projects/TCGA-GBM)
		- using LIMMA Package of R.
		- gene ontology analysis
		- protein interaction tool
		- Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes database
	- Similar Analyses

Conclusion: determined to do an analysis on a miRNA and see if it has the potential to be the prognostic marker for a cancer

- Bioinformatics analysis of prognostic value of PITX1 gene in breast cancer
- **miR-19b-3p in the tumorigenesis of colon cancer**

## Next Week
Goal for next two week: [[1209_to_1221 Analysis]]
- [ ] Do analysis 
	- [ ] Gene Ontology
	- [ ] Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes(KEGG)
	- [ ] PANTHER Pathway analysis
	- [ ] Disease ontology (DO) analysis
- [ ] Also find other analysis methods
	- [ ] TCGA?
	- [ ] GEO?
