      

To fulfill its role, the genetic material must meet four criteria.

1. **Information**: The genetic material must contain the

information necessary to construct an entire organism. In

other words, it must provide the blueprint to determine the

inherited traits of an organism.

2. **Transmission**: During reproduction, the genetic material

must be passed from parents to offspring.

3. **Replication**: Because the genetic material is passed from

parents to offspring, and from mother cell to daughter cells

during cell division, it must be copied.

4. **Variation**: Within any species, a significant amount of

phenotypic variability occurs. For example, Mendel studied

several characteristics in pea plants that varied among

different plants. These included height (tall versus dwarf)

and seed color (yellow versus green). Therefore, the genetic

material must also vary in ways that can account for the

known phenotypic differences within each species.
