## Nucleic Acid World
1. Transcribe DNA to protein
2. Control protein **productions**
3. **Structure of DNA & RNA**
## Sanger Sequencing Method
Also called *chain termination method* or *dideoxy DNA sequencing*

dideoxynucleotide: also called **chain terminating nucleotides**

## Next Generation Sequencing
Next-generation sequencing (NGS), also known as *high-throughput sequencing*, is the ==catch-all term used to describe a number of different modern sequencing technologies==. These technologies allow for sequencing of DNA and RNA much more quickly and cheaply than the previously used Sanger sequencing, and as such revolutionised the study of genomics and molecular biology. 

### Advantages
1. does not require *priori* (先驗的) knowledge of the genome
2. offers single-nucleotide resolution
3. higher dynamic range of signal
4. requires less DNA/RNA
5. higher reproducibility

 Ilumina Sequencing:
 1. let it denature
 2.  cycle through the 4 NTPs
 3.  color showing shows the sequence

## DNA is the information store, but RNA is the messenger
