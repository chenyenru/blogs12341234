Last week: did research on znf646, znf280c. Primarily struggling on finding an interesting thing to frame the topic.

notable things:
- familiarized myself with those databases.
	- including Firebrowse, TargetScan, TCGA, RNACards.
		- Learned how to navigate in those places
- identified 2 mirnas that are most conserved in znf646 and znf280c.
	- However, then found that they are already well-researched.

In a nutshell: was struggling with framing a research topic


Today, I've consulted someone who had past experience in the field, and he recommended me possibly frame my research topic as finding correlation between a gene or mirna and the development of cancer. Or that I can try to find something interesting from the gene's expression and perhaps investigate into its function.


THUS, my plan for next week: Draft a rough topic
1. start learning about genetics, genomics, proteins, mirnas, etc. from online courses
2. find interesting huge gene expression
